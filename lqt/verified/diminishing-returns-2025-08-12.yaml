  - The elimination of output regardless of inputs
  - The acceleration of production with more inputs

- question: In farming, diminishing returns might occur when?
  correct: Adding more fertilizer yields smaller increases in crop output
  incorrect:
  - Removing all fertilizer increases crop output
  - Using no fertilizer produces the best yield
  - Adding more fertilizer always doubles output

- question: What is marginal product?
  correct: The additional output produced by one more unit of input
  incorrect:
  - The total output from all inputs
  - The cost of producing all units
  - The profit after all expenses
  tags:

- question: Why do diminishing returns occur?
  correct: Because fixed resources limit the effectiveness of additional inputs
  incorrect:
  - Because inputs lose their value over time
  - Because demand always decreases
  - Because inputs become more expensive

- question: Which of the following is an example of diminishing returns in manufacturing?
  correct: Adding more workers to a fixed-size factory reduces productivity per worker
  incorrect:
  - Adding machines increases output at the same rate indefinitely
  - Fewer workers always produce more goods
  - Machines operate faster with no limit

- question: How is diminishing returns different from negative returns?
  correct: Diminishing returns still increase total output but at a slower rate
  incorrect:
  - Diminishing returns reduce total output immediately
  - Negative returns always increase total output
  - They are the same concept

- question: In business, diminishing returns might be seen when?
  correct: Increasing advertising budget yields fewer new customers per dollar
  incorrect:
  - Increasing advertising always doubles the customer base
  - Cutting the advertising budget increases customers
  - Advertising has no measurable effect
